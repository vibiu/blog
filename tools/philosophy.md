# Some Program Philosophy (Updating...)
## Windows

    Shield the users from everything that might get them into trouble.


## Unix

    Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
    Write programs to work together.
    Write programs to handlw text streams, because that is a universal interface.
    
    Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.


## Linux

    Treat all users with respect


## Zen of python

    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readablity counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguty, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do mort of those!
